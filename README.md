# Python Language Learning Game

## 2019 nwPlus Hack Day Project

We live in a multicultural society and the tech community is extremely diverse. We see the importance of being able to communicate with people from all parts of the world.

This is a Python-based dynamic web application built with Flask that allows English speakers to learn a new language by doing multiple choice quiz on a selected language. The objective is to correctly identify the English translation for the word being displayed.

The Yandex translation API was used for the basic fetching of foreign language words. Words are selecting randomly using Python and presented using HTML and CSS on a dynamic webpage and receive user input using Python. It outputs if the user made the correct selection and move on to the next level of words.
